//! ## Control flow graph
//!
//! We go from C to a mostly-purely-functional CFG representation where
//! every basic block consists of a single Mir expression + a maybe-conditional
//! jump.
//!
//! Each basic block has exactly one (implicit) parameter, just like each line
//! in a do-block has one implicit parameter, the previous result.
